# BUG BLATTER #

A simple, fun arcade-style game (reminiscent of "Space Zap") written in React, using the HTML5 canvas element.

Live demo: [BugBlatter](http://bugblatter.juddn.com/ "Bug Blatter")

Controls: use **arrow keys** (up, down, left, right) to fire lasers, **P** to Pause (or **mouse-click**, or **tap** for mobiles)
